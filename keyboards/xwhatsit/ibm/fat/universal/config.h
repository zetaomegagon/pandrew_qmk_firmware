// By default we set up for support of xwhatsit's solenoid driver board.
// Comment out HAPTIC_ENABLE_PIN if you don't have an enable pin:
#define HAPTIC_ENABLE_PIN D3
// Change this if you are using a different pin for the solenoid:
#define SOLENOID_PIN D2
// If you are not using a solenoid then comment out the above, and also in rules.mk, remove HAPTIC_ENABLE
// We disable haptic feedbeck during USB low power conditions:
#define HAPTIC_OFF_IN_LOW_POWER 1
// You can also tune the following for your solenoid:
#define SOLENOID_DEFAULT_DWELL 20
#define SOLENOID_MIN_DWELL 4
//#define SOLENOID_MAX_DWELL 100
#define NO_HAPTIC_MOD

// If the lock lights are not used, then please don't define the below pins,
// or leave them set as unused pins:

// The following definitions are compatible with the Model F SMD controllers
// from here: https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=24597 supporting the
// AT lock lights header
#define LED_NUM_LOCK_PIN D7
#define LED_CAPS_LOCK_PIN E6
#define LED_SCROLL_LOCK_PIN B6

// The following definitions match the lock lights as used by the original
// xwhatsit firmware, but enabling all three of these is not compatible with
// solenoid support
//#define LED_NUM_LOCK_PIN E6
//#define LED_CAPS_LOCK_PIN D2
//#define LED_SCROLL_LOCK_PIN D7

// Uncomment below if the leds are on when the pin is driving zero:
