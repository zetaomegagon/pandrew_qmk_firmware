A short description of the keyboard/project

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Purdea Andrei](https://github.com/purdeaandrei)
* Hardware Supported: Supports the FEXT keyboards, using the wcass controller PCB.

  The "wcass" controller design has been developed and published here: https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=13479

* Hardware Availability: Rare collector's item

These are IBM Model M, or Unicomp Model M full-size keyboards modified with an "FEXT" sense pcb, and Model F flippers.
For Unicomp keyboards only the winkeyless and tsangan bottom rows are supported. (If the keyboard has a menu key, it won't work)

The FEXT project has been developed here: https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?t=10744
