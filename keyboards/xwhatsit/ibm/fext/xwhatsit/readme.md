A short description of the keyboard/project

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Purdea Andrei](https://github.com/purdeaandrei)
* Hardware Supported: Supports the FEXT keyboards, using the original Xwhatsit model F rev. 1 or rev. 2 controller PCB.

  Design documentation for the original Xwhatsit boards can be found here: https://static.wongcornall.com/ibm-capsense-usb-web/ibm-capsense-usb.html
  Installation guides, open hardware source files, (and original firmware) are downloadable here: https://static.wongcornall.com/ibm-capsense-usb/

* Hardware Availability: Rare collector's item

These are IBM Model M, or Unicomp Model M full-size keyboards modified with an "FEXT" sense pcb, and Model F flippers.
For Unicomp keyboards only the winkeyless and tsangan bottom rows are supported. (If the keyboard has a menu key, it won't work)

The FEXT project has been developed here: https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?t=10744
