A short description of the keyboard/project

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Purdea Andrei](https://github.com/purdeaandrei)
* Hardware Supported: Supports the Beamspring full-size V1 by Model F Labs keyboards, using the original Xwhatsit model F rev. 1 or rev. 2 controller PCB.

  Design documentation for the original Xwhatsit boards can be found here: https://static.wongcornall.com/ibm-capsense-usb-web/ibm-capsense-usb.html
  Installation guides, open hardware source files, (and original firmware) are downloadable here: https://static.wongcornall.com/ibm-capsense-usb/

  The locklight leds are soldered to the extension header of the xwhatsit controller.

* Hardware Availability: Rare collector's item


WARNING: None of the keyboards that ship from modelfkeyboards.com come with a controller compatible with this firmware!
This firmware is only useful if you decide to modify your keyboard, and replace the controller PCB with a non-default one.
Otherwise please consult which controller you have in your keyboard and choose the correct one. Early keyboards shipped with the "wcass" controller,
and there are plans that in the future keyboards will be shipped with the "leyden_jar" controller.

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make xwhatsit/brand_new_model_f/beamspring_full/xwhatsit:default

See the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information. Brand new to QMK? Start with our [Complete Newbs Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).
