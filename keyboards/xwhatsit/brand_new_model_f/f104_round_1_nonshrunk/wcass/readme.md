A short description of the keyboard/project

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Purdea Andrei](https://github.com/purdeaandrei)
* Hardware Supported: Supports the F104 round 1 non-shrunk, by Model F Labs keyboards, using the wcass controller PCB.

  The "wcass" controller design has been developed and published here: https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=13479

  Note that the locklight leds are soldered to the extension header of the wcass controller, and the wiring is different between the nonshrunk and shrunk variants.

* Hardware Availability: Rare collector's item
